# Mini Message Board site

## Technologies used

- Express for routing
- EJS for templating
- DotEnv for environment setup

## Installation

I use pnpm, but it should work with any other package managers. Although, the
lockfile would not be used unless converted.

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

After that, the server should start on <http://localhost:3000>.
This can be configured in the `.env` file.
