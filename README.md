# Mini Message Board site

[Live Link](https://mini-message-board-qvk1.onrender.com)âœ¨

A message board where anyone can post their message on. It has data persistence
thanks to an online server.

## Technologies used

- Express for routing
- EJS for templating
- DotEnv for environment setup
- PostgreSQL for database management

## Installation

I use pnpm, but it should work with any other package managers. Although, the
lockfile would not be used unless converted.

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

After that, the server should start on <http://localhost:3000>.
This can be configured in the `.env` file.
